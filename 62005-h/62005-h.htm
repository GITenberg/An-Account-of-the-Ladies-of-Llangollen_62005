<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>LADY
ELEANOR CHARLOTTE BUTLER AND MISS SARAH PONSONBY,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF PLAS NEWYDD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> Eleanor Butler and Miss
Ponsonby were Irish ladies of rank and beauty, who loved each
other with an affection so true that they could never bear the
idea of the separation which the marriage of either would
necessitate.&nbsp; They, therefore, resolved on lives of
celibacy, and, refusing many handsome offers, fled from
home.&nbsp; They were, however, overtaken and brought back to
their respective relations.&nbsp; Many attempts were made to draw
Miss Butler into marriage, but all were in vain.&nbsp; In a short
time the ladies eloped again, each having a small sum with her;
and it was said that, although Lady Eleanor arrived here in the
natural aspect of a maid of 34, Miss Ponsonby accompanied her in
the guise of a smart footman, in top boots and buskin
breeches.&nbsp; It was about the year 1778 when these errant
ladies visited Llangollen.&nbsp; While rambling along this
charming locality, their eyes rested on a gentle eminence near
the village, and there they resolved to fix their abode.&nbsp;
They, accordingly, purchased the estate, built a new cottage on
the site of the old one, laid out gardens, pleasure grounds,
rural walks and bridges, by which they might enjoy the natural
charms of this picturesque retreat.&nbsp; Their mode of life
being very singular, and their costume still more so, they soon
became noticed by the many travellers who passed through North
Wales.&nbsp; The celebrated comedian Charles Mathews thus
describes their appearance:&mdash;<a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>&ldquo;As they are seated, there is
not one point to distinguish them from men; the dresses and
powdering of the hair, their well-starched neckcloths, the upper
part of their habits (which they always wear, even at a dinner
party) made precisely like men&rsquo;s coats, with regular black
beaver hats, everything contributing to this semblance.&nbsp; To
crown all, they had crop heads, which were rough, bushy, and
white as snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Plas Newydd was built at the north-east end of a field called
the <i>Maes</i>, and was, therefore, called
<i>Penymaes</i>&mdash;The end of the Maes.</p>
<p>The ladies were, according to their means, charitable to the
aged, sick, and infirm; and had been taught, by wisdom and
experience, that the best way to help the poor labourer was by
giving him employment.&nbsp; The workman, having precious
commodities for the market of the world&mdash;physical power,
knowledge, and good common sense&mdash;that were of more value to
society than gold or land, would, by being given an opportunity
to use his capacities, be able to support himself and family,
without losing his independence, and humbling himself to be a
crouching beggar, producing no honey to the common hive.&nbsp;
Although their farm had only thirteen acres of land&mdash;four of
their own, and nine held as tenants, they kept a carpenter, a
cowman, a man for all work on the farm, and in the hay-harvest an
additional number of men and poor women; with two ladies&rsquo;
maids and three female servants in the house.&nbsp; By the help
of these male hands, they made every inch of ground productive,
and every hedge-fence and walk pleasant to the sight&mdash;well
answering their end, and the house healthy, orderly, and
comfortable.&nbsp; In employing the labouring class, they were as
wise and praiseworthy as the Society of Friends.</p>
<p>We recollect another feature in the character of the Ladies of
Penymaes,&mdash;their non-interference with the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>religion of
their servants.&nbsp; They wished all to be religious, and
possess the root of the matter.&nbsp; Though they were <span
class="GutSmall">LADIES</span>, they left conscience to be ruled
by its rightful Owner; they followed the example of a certain
German sovereign, who, when some of his courtiers advised him to
compel all his subjects to be of the same religion as himself,
replied, &ldquo;I rule over the bodies of my faithful subjects;
as touching the soul I am not their king, but a fellow-subject
with them to the Great King, who <i>can</i> govern the soul, and
has reserved conscience as His own sacred province.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady Eleanor and the Honourable Miss Ponsonby knew too well that
coercion might make people worthless hypocrites; but teaching the
truth, a life consistent with the truth of God, with loving
persuasion, only could make sincere followers of Him, who says,
My son, give me <i>thine heart</i>.</p>
<p>Allow us to relate another incident in the lives of the Ladies
of Llangollen that fell under our observation, under the
following heading:&mdash;<i>Kindness creates kindness and
liberality</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Jones, of Bachau Mill, and the
minister of Penybryn Chapel were the collectors for the Bible
Society through the township of Bachau, from year to year, for
thirty years.&nbsp; Penymaes being in their district, the
collectors called there as well as every other house in the
township, and were received with a smile, wishes of success, and
a handsome subscription from the ladies&rsquo; maids, Misses
Elizabeth and Jane Hughes, and something from the other
servants.&nbsp; Either Miss Jane or Miss Elizabeth would always
present the collecting book to the ladies.&nbsp; But the book,
for years, would be returned from the ladies&rsquo; room, without
anything to gladden the collectors&rsquo; hearts.&nbsp; However,
one year, Miss Jane said, with a double smile, and appearance of
confidence on her face, &ldquo;Please, I will take your book to
Lady Eleanor and Miss Ponsonby.&rdquo;&nbsp; She soon returned
with a yellow piece that did gladden the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>hearts of the
collectors, and added, &ldquo;You must be sure, every year, to
call on the ladies.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so they did as long as the
last of them remained on earth, and met with equal success and
cheerfulness.&nbsp; The collectors had no clue to the welcome
change at Penymaes, in collecting, for years after the death of
Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp; In course of time, Miss June Hughes (now
Mrs. Roberts, Ormonde Cottage, Berwyn Street,) was united in
marriage to Mr. Edward Roberts, timber merchant, and attended the
means of grace at Penybryn Chapel, and became a useful member
there.&nbsp; When the minister of Penybryn was taking tea at her
house, she asked him, &ldquo;Do you remember the time you and Mr.
Jones received the first half-sovereign for the Bible Society
from the dear ladies!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, as it were
yesterday, but we know not the cause of our success.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I shall tell you.&nbsp; Do you remember Lady
Eleanor&rsquo;s severe illness about two years before she
died?&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister replied, &ldquo;I do, and shall
never forget it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You, therefore, remember
your praying so earnestly for her, and for her recovery, that
you, and many of the congregation, were moved to tears?&nbsp;
Next day, someone, that was present at Penybryn, described at
Plas Newydd the remarkable prayer, and its effects upon yourself
and those present.&nbsp; When the ladies heard of the prayer they
felt so much that they remembered the words of the Apostle James
(chap. v. 16), &lsquo;The <i>effectual fervent</i> prayer of a
righteous man availeth much.&rsquo;&nbsp; And Lady Eleanor soon
recovered, and was restored to her usual health: and both
believed that the God of the Bible had saved her life, and
restored her health, and determined, to the end of their days, to
subscribe for the Bible; and so they did, as you
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister thanked Mrs. Roberts for the
encouraging relation that revealed the secret of the
collectors&rsquo; success, on behalf of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, at Plas Newydd.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Miss
Seward, the clever and amusing gossip, says of the
&ldquo;ladies,&rdquo; whom she rhapsodizes as &ldquo;the
enchantreses&rdquo; of Plas Newydd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lady Eleanor is of middle height, and
somewhat beyond the <i>embonpoint</i> as to plumpness; her face
round and fair, with the glow of luxuriant health.&nbsp; She has
not fine features, but they are agreeable; enthusiasm in her eye,
hilarity and benevolence in her smile.&nbsp; Exhaustless is her
fund of historic and traditionary knowledge, and of everything
passing in the present eventful period.&nbsp; She expresses all
she feels with an ingenuous ardour, at which the cold-spirited
beings stare.&nbsp; I am informed that both these ladies read and
speak most of the modern languages.&nbsp; Of the Italian poets,
especially of Dante, they are warm admirers.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby,
somewhat taller than her friend, is neither slender nor
otherwise, but very graceful.&nbsp; Easy, elegant, yet pensive,
is her address and manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Her voice, like
lovers&rsquo; watched, is kind and low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A face rather long than round, a complexion clear but
without bloom, with a countenance which, from its soft
melancholy, has a peculiar interest.&nbsp; If her features are
not beautiful, they are very sweet and feminine.&nbsp; Though the
pensive spirit within permits not her lovely dimples to give
mirth to her smile, they increase its sweetness, and,
consequently, her power of engaging the affections.&nbsp; We see,
through her veil of shading reserve, that all the talents and
accomplishments which enrich the mind of Lady Eleanor exist, with
equal powers, in this her charming friend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The celebrated Madame de Genlis, in an entertaining
miscellany, under the title of &ldquo;Souvenirs de Felicie
L&mdash;,&rdquo; has given the following graphic narrative of
&ldquo;The Fair Recluses of Llangollen:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>During my residence in England, nothing struck <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>me so much as
the delicious cottage of Llangollen, in North Wales.&nbsp; It is
not a little extraordinary, that a circumstance, so singular and
remarkable, as that connected with this retreat, should hitherto
have escaped the notice of all modern travellers.&nbsp; The
manner in which I became acquainted with it was
this:&mdash;During our long stay at Bury, a small company of five
or six persons, including ourselves, met every evening from seven
till half-past ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We diverted ourselves
with music and conversation, so that the time passed very
agreeably.&nbsp; One night, friendship happened to be the subject
of conversation, and I declared that I would with pleasure
undertake a long journey to see two persons who had long been
united by the bonds of genuine friendship.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
madam,&rsquo; replied Mr. Stuart (now Lord Castlereagh),
&lsquo;go to Llangollen; you will there see a model of perfect
friendship, which, will afford you the more delight, as it is
exhibited by two females who are yet young and charming in every
respect.&nbsp; Would you like to hear the history of Lady Eleanor
Butler and Miss Ponsonby?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It would give me
the greatest pleasure.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I will relate it to
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; At these words the company drew nearer to Mr.
Stuart, we formed a little circle round him, and after
recollecting himself a few moments, he thus began his
narrative:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Eleanor Butler was born in Dublin.&nbsp; She was
left an orphan while in her cradle; and possessing an ample
fortune, together with an amiable disposition and a beautiful
person, her hand was solicited by persons belonging to the first
families in Ireland.&nbsp; At an early age she manifested great
repugnance to the idea of giving herself a master.&nbsp; This
love of independence, which she never dissembled, did no injury
to her reputation; her conduct has always been irreproachable,
and no female is more highly distinguished for sweetness of
temper, modesty, and all the virtues which adorn her <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>sex.&nbsp; In
early life a mutual attachment took place between her and Miss
Ponsonby, by an accident, which made a deep impression on their
imagination.&nbsp; They had no difficulty to persuade themselves
that heaven had formed them for each other; that is, that it had
designed each of them to devote her existence to the other, so
that they might glide together down the stream of life, in the
bosom of peace, the most intimate friendship, and delicious
independence.&nbsp; This idea their sensibility was destined to
realize.&nbsp; Their friendship gradually grew stronger with
their years, so that when Miss Ponsonby was seventeen, and Lady
Eleanor Butler thirty-four, they mutually engaged never to
sacrifice their liberty, or to part from each other.&nbsp; From
that moment they formed the design of withdrawing from the world,
and of settling for good in some sequestered retreat.&nbsp;
Having heard of the charming scenery of Wales, they secretly
absconded from their friends for the purpose of fixing upon their
future residence.&nbsp; They visited Llangollen, and there, on
the summit of a hill, they found a little detached cottage, with
the situation of which they were delighted.&nbsp; Here they
resolved to form their establishment.&nbsp; Meanwhile the
guardians of the young fugitives sent people after them, and they
were conveyed back to Dublin.&nbsp; They declared that they would
return to their hill as soon as they were free.&nbsp;
Accordingly, when Miss Ponsonby was twenty-one, in spite of the
entreaties and remonstrances of their relatives and friends, they
quitted Ireland for ever, and flew to Llangollen.&nbsp; Miss
Ponsonby is not rich, but Lady Eleanor possesses a considerable
fortune.&nbsp; She purchased the little hut and the property of
the hill, where she built a cottage, very simple in external
appearance, but the interior of which displays the greatest
elegance.&nbsp; On the top of the hill she has formed about the
house a court and flower-garden; a hedge of rosebushes is the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>only enclosure
that surrounds this rural habitation.&nbsp; A convenient
carriage-road, the steepness of which has been diminished by art,
was carried along the hill.&nbsp; On the aide of the latter some
ancient pines of prodigious height were preserved; fruit trees
were planted, and a great number of cherry trees in particular,
which produce the best and finest cherries in England.&nbsp; The
two friends likewise possess a farm for their cattle, with a
pretty farm-house and a kitchen-garden close by.&nbsp; In this
sequestered abode, these two extraordinary persons, with minds
equally cultivated, and accomplishments equally pleasing, have
now resided ten years, without ever having been absent from it a
single night.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they are not unsociable; they
sometimes pay visits to the neighbouring gentry, and receive,
with the greatest politeness, travellers on their way to or from
Ireland, who are recommended to them by any of their old
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This account strongly excited my curiosity, and produced the
same effect on Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Orleans and my two young
companions.&nbsp; We determined the same night to set out
immediately for Llangollen, by the circuitous route of Brighton,
Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; It was the latter end of
July when we arrived at Llangollen.&nbsp; This place has not the
rich appearance of the English villages in general, but nothing
can equal the cleanliness of the houses, and among the lower
classes of any country this is an infallible proof of
abundance.&nbsp; Llangollen, surrounded with woods and meadows,
clothed with the freshest verdure, is situated at the foot of the
hill belonging to the two friends, which there forms a majestic
pyramid covered with trees and flowers.&nbsp; We arrived at the
cottage, the only object of our journey, an hour before
sunset.</p>
<p>The two friends had received in the morning by a <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>messenger the
letter which Mr. Stuart had given me for them.&nbsp; We were
received with a grace, a cordiality, and kindness, of which it
would be impossible for me to give any idea.&nbsp; I could not
turn my eyes from those two ladies, rendered so interesting by
their friendship and so extraordinary on account of their way of
life.&nbsp; I perceived in them none of that vanity which takes
delight in the surprise of others.&nbsp; Their mutual attachment,
and their whole conduct evince such simplicity, that astonishment
soon gives way to softer emotions; all they do and say breathes
the utmost frankness and sincerity.&nbsp; One circumstance which
I cannot help remarking is, that after living so many years in
this sequestered retreat, they speak French with equal fluency
and purity. * * * An excellent library, composed of the best
English, French, and Italian authors, affords them an
inexhaustible source of diversified amusement and solid
occupation; for reading is not truly profitable except when a
person has time to read again.</p>
<p>The interior of the house is delightful on account of the just
proportion and distribution of the apartments, the elegance of
the ornaments and furniture, and the admirable view which you
enjoy from all the windows; the drawing-room is adorned with
charming landscapes, drawn and coloured from nature, by Miss
Ponsonby.&nbsp; Lady Eleanor is a great proficient in music; and
their solitary habitation is filled with embroidery, by them
both, of wonderful execution.&nbsp; Miss Ponsonby, who writes the
finest hand I ever saw, has copied a number of select pieces in
verse and prose, which she has ornamented with vignettes and
arabesques, in the best taste, and which form a most valuable
collection.&nbsp; Thus the arts are cultivated there with equal
modesty and success, and their productions are admired with a
feeling that is not experienced elsewhere; the spectator <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>observes with
delight that so much merit is secure in this peaceful retreat
from the shafts of satire and envy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several little reminiscences of the Ladies of
Penymaes to be gleaned from the few remaining old residents, such
as their habit of distributing sixpenny pieces on Sunday mornings
on their way to Church, which was always down Butler&rsquo;s Hill
and along Church Street to the gate which formerly stood in the
same street.&nbsp; Their influence was considered paramount, and
very solicitous were the labouring classes and tradespeople for
their patronage and countenance.&nbsp; During hay-harvest, the
poor women of the village were wont to scrape a few pence for the
purpose of buying a quart of beer for the mowers in the
ladies&rsquo; field, for the sake of their certain
acknowledgment, and thereby causing a superfluity of drink to run
during the ladies&rsquo; harvest.&nbsp; The poor cottage
gardeners of the neighbourhood used to vie with each other in
being the first in tendering their earliest and finest vegetables
to the ladies.&nbsp; The working tradesmen of the town would
leave any work unfinished to attend to the building and other
tastes of Miss Ponsonby.</p>
<p>They were deemed all-powerful intercessors with the magistracy
and government.&nbsp; Many a mother has stood, twirling her
apron, at that dark threshold, whilst recounting her sorrowful
tale about her Will or Tom having got into a scrape, and
consequent durance, and had her burden lightened by the
sympathetic countenance of Lady Eleanor, being at the same time
edified by the wholesome advice of Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp; Fancy
recalls her lightened step and brightened face, as she turned
away with the much-desired promise of their advocacy.&nbsp; Their
influence proved sufficient even to save the life of one young
man, who had been sentenced to death for forgery.&nbsp; Their
qualities were such that their whole lives were spent in
performing worthy deeds.&nbsp; <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Good actions, like sweet herbs, have
a retentive perfume.&nbsp; May their memory be long cherished as
virtuous exponents of that paternal and sympathetic life of the
upper order which knits class to class, and has a strong,
refining influence on the poor and lowly.</p>
<p>On June 2nd, 1829, death severed the faithful friendship which
had existed for so many years between the eccentric residents at
Plas Newydd, by removing from this earthly scene Lady Eleanor
Butler, who had attained the advanced age of ninety.&nbsp; On
December 9th, 1831, Miss Ponsonby also died.&nbsp; They are both
buried in the Churchyard of Llangollen, where a stone monument is
erected to their memory.&nbsp; On this record of mortality are
inserted the following memorials:&mdash;</p>

LADIES OF LLANGOLLEN.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Once</span> two young girls
of rank and beauty rare,<br />
Of features more than ordinary fair,<br />
Who in the heyday of their youthful charms<br />
Refused the proffer of all suitors&rsquo; arms,<br />
Lived in a cottage here rich carved in oak,<br />
Though now long passed from life by death&rsquo;s grim stroke.<br
/>
Plas Newydd&rsquo;s gardens then displayed much taste,<br />
And nought about them e&rsquo;er allowed to waste.<br />
The umbrageous foliage of surrounding trees<br />
Gave them a shelter from the stormy breeze,<br />
Whilst in a snug retreat about south-west,<br />
Was bird-cote placed as shelter for redbreast,<br />
For sparrow, chaffinch, blackbird, or for thrush,<br />
These ladies did not wish the cold to touch.<br />
Then did all species of ferns abound<br />
In every nook and corner of their ground,<br />
Then none were known to come unto their door<br />
That were not welcomed with kind words, or more.<br />
These ladies to each other kind and true,<br />
Around Llangollen&rsquo;s vale, like them were few.<br />
E&rsquo;en now I see them seated in yon chair,<br />
In well-starched neckcloths, and with powdered hair,<br />
Their upper habits just like men&rsquo;s they wore,<br />
With tall black beaver hats outside their door;<br />
To crown it all my muse would whisper low,<br />
With hair cropped short, rough, bushy, white as snow.<br />
They at death&rsquo;s summons, God&rsquo;s commands obeyed,<br />
And were in fair Llangollen&rsquo;s churchyard laid,<br />
As they through life together did abide,<br />
E&rsquo;en now in death they both lie side by side;<br />
Of them remains nought save dark mould and sod,<br />
Who loved their neighbours second to their God;<br />
Sweet peace be theirs&mdash;by death to dust allied,<br />
Through him who near a century was their Guide;<br />
Beloved, respected by the world were they,<br />
By all regretted when they passed away.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span><span
class="smcap">Plas Newydd</span> was purchased by General Yorke,
C.B., in 1876.&nbsp; He knew the Ladies intimately in his Eton
school-boy days, and has saved their cottage from decay, and
filled the rooms with antiquities and curiosities, and all
persons express delight on leaving the grounds.&nbsp; In
1878&ndash;79 the General made an extensive new wing to the back
of the house.&nbsp; He spends his summer months at this
delightful retreat, and is becoming a general favourite in the
town, imitating the old Ladies in his liberality and
kindness.&nbsp; He takes great delight in carving, and much of
his handi-work may be seen in and about the house.&nbsp; It is
very fortunate that the property fell to the hands of the present
proprietor, whose constant aim is to improve and keep it in the
most perfect repair.&nbsp; May the gallant general be long spared
to reside amongst us.&nbsp; He has been happy in the selection of
Mr. Joseph Davies and his amiable wife Mrs. Davies to look after
the place, who are most careful to keep everything in the house
and grounds in proper trim, and most attentive and obliging to
visitors, who are admitted daily, on payment of a small fee.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
